# single_neural_network
Code for a simple neural network.

This is a single layer feedforward neural network(perceptron).
Binary digits are used as inputs and also expected as outputs.
Backpropagation is used via gradient descent in order to make the prediction as accurate as possible.

Numpy is the only dependency used.
